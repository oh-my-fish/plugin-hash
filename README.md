# hash
Plugin for [Oh My Fish][omf].

Computes string digests using various hashing algorithms.

## Install
```fish
$ omf install hash
```

## Usage
The `hash` function does just one simple thing: it takes an algorithm and a string, computes the string's hash with the given algorithm, and prints out the result. The string to digest can be provided either as an argument, or piped in from standard input:

```fish
# command line argument...
$ hash md5 "Hello World!"
# ...or piped
$ cat myfile.txt | hash md5
```

The available algorithms depend on what utilities you have installed on your system. If you have GNU coreutils installed, any of the algorithms that have an `<algorithm>sum` command will be available. On BSD, the core digest commands provide the `md5`, `sha1`, `sha256`, `sha512`, and `rmd160` algorithms. Finally, if OpenSSL is installed, any algorithm installed for OpenSSL will also be available. To see if a given algorithm is available, you can run

```fish
$ hash -q <algorithm>
```
